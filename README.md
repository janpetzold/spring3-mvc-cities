spring-3-mvc-cities
===================

This is a simple Spring 3 MVC web project based on Spring 3, Hibernate/JPA and client-side jQuery + Datatables plugin for a very basic web application. This app was part of an article that I wrote for [heise online](http://heise.de/-1623020). It also includdes the usage of hibernate-search to integrate auto-completion for simple search queries.

You can see an online version here:

For the sample data I used the (outdated but sufficient) [world-database](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html) from MySQL. You need to have MySQL running on your machine with the default settings to make any use of this example.

The app is based on Spring 3.0 and uses Maven for its dependency management.
