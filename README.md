spring-3-mvc-cities
===================

This is a simple Spring 3 MVC web project based on Spring 3, Hibernate/JPA and client-side jQuery + Datatables plugin for a very basic web application. This app was part of an article that I wrote for [heise online](http://heise.de/-1623020). It also includdes the usage of hibernate-search to integrate auto-completion for simple search queries.

For the sample data I used the (outdated but sufficient) [world-database](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html) from MySQL.

The app is based on Spring 3.0 and uses maven for its dependency management.
